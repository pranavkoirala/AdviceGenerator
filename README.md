## My process

I started with the square in the middle and did the button first along with the javascript for the button before the css. After I had the button
down the css was pretty simple but I had some problem with text shrinking too much in the mobile version so eventually I just gave up trying to 
make a mobile specific version and the desktop version actually seemed to work just fine shrinked down.

### Continued development

Things that I need to continue development on is formatting and writing better code as in class names and variables. Whenever I asked my friend
for help he always pointed it out.
